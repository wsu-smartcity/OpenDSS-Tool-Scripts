Latest updates on the python scripts for GridLAB-D can be found here: https://github.com/gridlab-d/tools/tree/master/python_scripts

## GridLAB-D

1) The fault_check object is explained here: https://sourceforge.net/p/gridlab-d/discussion/842562/thread/1a7609d0/
2) If the entry glm file has brackets ('[' and/or ']') in its filename, the use of "#include" will trigger a syntax error.
3) This command "gridlabd --modhelp powerflow:OBJECT_NAME" (e.g., gridlabd --modhelp powerflow:triplex_load) can be used to display all parameters of an object. Another option is to check the source code.

## OpenDSS
